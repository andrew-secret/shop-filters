# 2ndStore thuglife documentation
This is my little side project to learn about `react` and sophisticated state management.

## Installation
The very first thing is to setup the correct node-version.

```
$ nvm install
```

Now you have to install the dependencies. Grab your coffee and do:
```
$ yarn install
```

## Connect to firebase
You have to add credentials to the project. There's a `.env.sample` file in the root directory of the project, where you can find the required information. The `db.json` serve some data for the project, you could use it in firebase to provide some data.

## Development
Okay let's get serious.

To run the project you have to do:

```
$ yarn start
```
now you can see content on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

To run some tests you could do:

```
$ yarn test
```

You will see that I haven't wrote any tests yet.
